##Welcome to the MeYou Health Style Guide##

We've created this guide to ensure that our written content and style are consistent, and to clarify the correct usage of some common words and phrases. Because we are a well-being company, there is also a section on preferred medical terms and usage. If you work at a different organization, we invite you to check out this style guide and adapt it for your own use.  

## Consistency

### A

* AM and PM, not am and pm or a.m. and p.m. (Use small caps if possible.)

### C

* check in is a verb; check-in is a noun *(Examples: Please check in at the desk. Mobile check-in is available starting today.)*

### D

* database, one word

### F

* fractions: Always spell out. One third, not ⅓. (Exception: in recipes)

* full time/part time: have a hyphen when used as adjectives but not when used as adverbs *(Examples: He is a full-time employee. I work part time.)*

### H

* health care, not healthcare

* health care provider, not health-care provider

* HRA or health risk assessment

### I

* internet, lowercase "i"

### J

* judgment: omit the "e"

### L

* log in is a verb; login is a noun *(Example: Log in on this screen. Your login is sangamon_t.)*

* log into, not log in to *(Example: Log into your account.)*

### M

* members, not users

### N

* non: prefix doesn't use a hyphen unless it's followed by a capitalized word or a word that starts with "n" *(Examples: nonprofit, nonfat BUT non-Catholic, non-negotiable)*

### O

* OK, not O.K, ok, or okay

* online, one word

### P

* percent: Use %, do not spell out. Should be used after each numeral. 15% to 20%, not 15 to 20% or 15-20%

* phone numbers: (xxx) xxx-xxxx. You don’t need a “1” before the first parenthesis.

* pre- and post- : no hyphen unless followed by capitals *(Examples: prenatal, postgraduate, pre-MIT)*

### Q

* QuitNet, not Quitnet

### R

* re- : Doesn't normally take a hyphen. Takes a hyphen when closing the prefix would accidentally create another word *(Examples: reconstruct, reopen* BUT *re-present, re-creation)*

### S

* single sign-on, not single signon

* smartphone, not smart phone

* startup, not start-up or start up. Can be used in this form as an adjective *(Example: startup culture)* and a noun *(Example: Check out this new Boston startup)*

* SSO, not sso

### T

* Temperature: use Fahrenheit followed by Celsius

* Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are both capped. Note that the "o" in "of" is not capped.

* Time: include hour and minute. *(Example: Make sure you are here by 2:00 PM.* NOT *2 PM)* Put a space between the numerals and the first letter.

* turn-key, not turnkey or turn key

* type 2 diabetes, not Type 2 or Type II

### U

### W

* web, lowercase

* website, one word, lowercase

* well: Hyphenate it when it's a compound adjective before a noun, but don't hyphenate when it comes after the noun. *(Examples: It is a well-defined role. I bet her role is well defined.)*

* well-being, not wellbeing or well being

* white paper, two words

### Z

* ZIP Code, not Zip code or zipcode

##Style##

**Acronyms and Abbreviations**

Neither require periods after each letter. *(Examples: SCUBA, MGH)* Avoid using them in a title or subtitle.

**Addresses**

* spell out Road, Street, Boulevard, Lane, etc.
* spell out the direction of a street name *(Example: 125 South Walnut Street)*
* never abbreviate the name of any city, except for St. *(Examples: St. Louis, St. Paul)*
* unless it's within a mailing address, never abbreviate the name of a state *(Example: Our home office is located in Massachusetts.)*

**Ampersands**

Don't use them in text. It's OK to use them when they are part of a proper noun or you are referring to a page title that contains one. *(Examples: Welcome to the Foundation for Art & Healing. Please go to our Help & Support page to learn more.)*

**Apostrophes**

Don't use them to make something plural. *(Examples: 1980s, ABCs, piñatas, cabanas)*


**Bullets**

Use them to make a long, multiclause sentence easier to read. Precede the bullets with a word that is common to all the bullets. Follow that word with a colon. If the bulleted list involves complete sentences, capitalize and punctuate each item.

_Example:_

_There are three reasons why we can't give you a raise:_

* _We often find you asleep at your desk._
* _Your colleagues say you are insufferable._
* _You have been wearing your Halloween costume for a month now._

But if the list involves sentence fragments, don't capitalize after the bullet or punctuate after each item.

_Example:_

_We can't give you a raise because you are:_
* _often asleep at your desk_
* _insufferable_
* _stinky in your Halloween costume_

**Citations**

Titles of books, movies, TV shows, and articles go in quotes. *(Examples: "Apex Hides the Hurt" "Run Lola Run" "Bojack Horseman" "Street Style: Paris Fashion Week")*.

**Colons**

Use colons to direct attention to:

*  a list _(Example: I am guilty of three of the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, and sloth.)_
*  a quotation _(Example: Consider the words of Minnie Riperton: "Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful.")_

Don't use capitalization after a colon in text, unless it's in a heading or subheading. *(Example: "Patient: The True Story of a Rare Illness")*

**Commas**

Use a serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma) before "and" or "or" in a series. *(Example: I went to the store for beer, ice cream, and fireworks.)*

Use a comma to set off the year in a complete date, but don't use a comma within the month and year. *(Examples: Be sure to offload your steps by October 31, 2016.* BUT *The contest will end in October 2016.)*

For professional degrees, use a comma after the degree if the name doesn't end the sentence. *(Example: Meghan Neuringer, MD, will meet with you now.)*

Use a comma between the elements of an address. *(Example: The party bus left Boston, Massachusetts on Friday and arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada the following Wednesday.)*

**Company name**

Our official company name is MYH, Inc. You can write “MeYou Health,” or you can write “MYH, Inc.,” but do not write “MeYou Health, Inc.”

Don’t refer to MeYou Health as “MeYou”

Don’t refer to MeYou Health as MYH in first reference. You can refer to MeYou Health as MYH in second and subsequent references. *(Example: MeYou Health helps you do more. Let MYH demo its platform for you today.)*

Whenever possible, do not use “MeYou Health’s” when writing. *(Examples: MeYou Health technology improves your population’s well-being. The MeYou Health well-being platform drives engagement.)*

**Ellipses**

A space appears before the first period and after the third period. *(Example: Try it out ... you might like it!)*

**Exclamation points**

Use only one at the end of a sentence, no matter how excited you are. (**Note:** If you use one in a headline, avoid using one in the first few lines of the body copy that accompanies it.)

**Hyphens**

Use them to:

* separate parts of compound words. If you are in doubt, use a dictionary to learn whether to use one word, two words, or one hyphenated word. *(Example: water-repellant* BUT *waterproof*)

* connect a compound adjective *(Examples: That's not an FDA-approved drug! Thank goodness they provide after-hour care.)*

* avoid confusion. Hyphenating to separate awkward double or triple letters makes it easier for the reader. *(Examples: anti-intellectual, re-examine, pre-existing)*

* avoid ambiguity *(Example: She will speak to small-business women.* [not short females] *The new-business analyst is here.* [someone who anazlyzes new businesses, not a new person on the job.]

Suspend hyphens when using them in a series. *(Example: Do you want a first-, second-, or third-class ticket?)*

Words that end in "ly" don't take a hyphen. *(Example: A fully functional platform* NOT *A fully-functional platform)*


**Job titles**

Use uppercase for professional job titles that precede a name. *(Examples: Chief Financial Officer Erin McGarry. Product Manager Liana Leahy.* But use lowercase for titles that follow a name. *Erin McGarry is the chief financial officer. Liana Leahy is a product manager.)*

When referring to a doctor, follow the name by the professional degree in first reference, then include the title in second reference. *(Example: Nathan Cobb, MD, spoke at the conference. The audience had a lot of questions for Dr. Cobb.)*

Degrees are lowercase when they are spelled out. *(Example: Llaen Coston-Clark has a master of arts in health communication. BUT Llaen Coston-Clark, MA.)*

When referring to a person, use first and last name on first reference. In second reference, use the last name only. *(Example: Trapper Markelz will be speaking at the event. Markelz will take questions in the bar afterward.)*

**Numbers and numerals**

* Write out numbers from one to nine. Use numerals for 10 to infinity. *(Examples: Nine, 9,788)*

* Use numerals when modifying a unit of measure (such as years, ounces, inches) *(Examples: 6 inches, 4 ounces)*

* Use numerals when writing ages. *(Examples: age 3 and up, a 27-year-old)*

**Semicolons**

Semicolons represent a more definite break than commas and are generally used to separate two independent clauses. In many cases, it's equally correct to use a period and create two sentences. *(Example: "Many of the authors were just great; a few were terrible.")*

**Question marks**

Use only one at the end of a sentence, no matter how urgent your question.

**Quotation marks**

They always go outside of commas, periods, exclamation points, question marks, and ellipses.

_Examples:_

* _"I think I've found the answer!"_
* _"Oh, really?"_
* _"Well ..." he said, "maybe not."_
* _"That's OK." She smiled. "There's always next time."_

##Usage##

**Affect/Effect**

Affect as a verb means to have an influence on. Effect as a verb means to bring about our cause. They can't be used interchangeably. *(Examples: Her work was sorely affected by the size of her desk.* BUT *She began feeling the effects of the smoke right away.)*

Affect as a noun refers to immediate expressions of emotion. Unless your topic is psychology, you will rarely need to use the noun affect.

**Although/While** and **Because/Since**

Use "although" instead of "while" unless you are talking about two things that happen simultaneously. *(Example: Although his friend was pretty tense, he was totally relaxed* NOT *While his friend was pretty tense, he was totally relaxed)*

Use "because" instead of "since" unless you are talking about a period of time that has passed during which an action hasn't occurred. *(Example: Because pets get into everything, it's smart to keep snacks on a high shelf* NOT *Since pets get into everything, it's smart to keep snacks on a high shelf)*

Use "since" when talking about a period of time that has passed. *(Example: Since he left last January, we don't do as much laughing around here.)*

**e.g. and i.e.**

e.g. is from the Latin *exempli gratia*: "for example" and i.e. is from *id est*: "that is." The use of i.e. implies that the items that follow are specific and conclusive. A comma follows each one. *(Examples: Bring something fun to the party, e.g., gin, candy, confetti.)* BUT *Tomorrow I will wear my favorite socks, i.e., the ones with the glittery orange stars.)*        

**Farther/Further**

Farther is for literal distance; further refers to figurative distance. *(Examples: Bali is farther away than I expected.* BUT *Let me look into this travel situation further.)*

**It's/Its**

"It's" is the contraction for "it is." "Its" is the possessive form of a pronoun. *(Examples: It's time to frost your cake.* [short for "It is time to frost your cake."] *The frosting is the least of its problems.* [the problems "belong" to the cake.]

**Less/Fewer**

Use "less" when you’re referring to something that can’t you can't count or make plural, like music or snow. Use "fewer" with objects you are referring to in the plural, like guinea pigs or books. *(Examples: I listen to less music today than I did a couple of years ago. He'd like to live in a place with less snow.* BUT *There were fewer guinea pigs in the cage than she expected! The store sells fewer books now.)* 

**That/Which**

"That" introduces a limiting or defining clause. "Which" introduces a nondefining or parenthetical clause, and is always preceded by a comma. *(Examples: Downtown Crossing, which is a great place to see Keytar Bear, is only 15 minutes from here.* BUT *The keytar is the instrument that he uses to create memorable jams.)*

##Medical terms and preferred usage##

* syndrome is lowercase *(Example: Down syndrome)*

* “'s” is sometimes but not always used with the proper name of a disease or syndrome *(Example: Tourette syndrome* BUT *Ewing’s sarcoma.)* Look it up in an approved source if you aren’t sure.

* If a disease has a person’s name or place in the name, the first letter is capitalized. The second word is not. *(Examples: Lyme disease, Alzheimer’s disease)*

* Do not capitalize generic names like aspirin. Brand names (e.g., Tylenol) are capped.

* People with diabetes, children with epilepsy, etc. NOT diabetics, epileptics, etc. Same goes for mental and emotional health. A person with schizophrenia or a person who experiences depression, NOT a schizophrenic or a depressive.

* Words to avoid: afflicted, suffering, victim. A person has multiple sclerosis and is not afflicted with, suffering from, or a victim of multiple sclerosis.

* Disabled is a widely accepted adjective. Physically or (intellectually) disabled are common; special needs (as in "special needs children") is also OK but not used as often. Sometimes intellectual disability is referred to as developmental disability, but that is a broader term that refers to disabilities that develop from birth to age 18.

* Avoid phrases that focus on limitations and stress adaptive abilities instead. She uses a wheelchair; NOT She is wheelchair-bound.
