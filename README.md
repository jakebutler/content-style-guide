### C

* check in is a verb; check-in is a noun *(Examples: Please check in at the desk. Mobile check-in is available starting today.)*

### D

* database, one word

### F

* fractions: Always spell out. One-third, not ⅓. (Exception: in recipes)

* follow up is a verb; follow-up is a noun *(Examples: We are writing to follow up. I want to schedule a follow-up.)*

* full time/part time: have a hyphen when used as adjectives but not when used as adverbs *(Examples: He is a full-time employee. I work part time.)*

### H

* health care provider, not health-care provider

* HRA or health risk assessment

### I

* internet, lowercase "i"

### J

### L

* log into, not log in to. *(Example: Log into your account.)*

### M

### O

* OK, not O.K. or okay

* online, one word

### P

* percent: Use %, do not spell out. Should be used after each numeral. 15% to 20%, not 15 to 20% or 15-20%

* pre- and post- : no hyphen unless followed by capitals *(Examples: prenatal, postgraduate, pre-MIT)*

### W

* web, lowercase

* website, one word, lowercase

* white paper, two words

### Z

* ZIP Code, not Zip code or zipcode

##Style##

### A

**Acronyms and Abbreviations**

Neither require periods after each letter *(Examples: SCUBA, MGH)* Avoid using them in the title or subtitle.

**Addresses**

* spell out Road, Street, Boulevard, Lane, etc.
* spell out the direction of a street name *(Example: 125 South Walnut Street)*
* never abbreviate the name of any city, except for St. *(Examples: St. Louis, St. Paul)*
* unless it's within a mailing address, never abbreviate the name of a state *(Example: Our home office is located in Massachusetts.)*

**Apostrophes**

Don't use them to make something plural. *(Examples: 1980s, ABCs)*

### B

**Bullets**

Use them to make a long, multiclause sentence easier to read. Precede the bullets with a word that is common to all the bullets. Follow that word with a colon. If the bulleted list involves complete sentences, capitalize and punctuate each item.

_Example:_

_There are three reasons why we can't give you a raise:_

* _We often find you asleep at your desk._
* _Your colleagues say you are insufferable._
* _You have been wearing a your Halloween costume for a month now._

But if the list involves sentence fragments, don't capitalize after the bullet or punctuate after each item.

_Example:_

_We can't give you a raise because you are:_
* _often asleep at your desk_
* _insufferable_
* _stinky in your Halloween costume_

### C

**Citations**

Titles of books, movies, TV shows, and articles go in quotes. *(Examples: "Apex Hides the Hurt" "Run Lola Run" "Bojack Horseman" "Street Style: Paris Fashion Week")*.

**Colons**

Use colons to direct attention to:

*  a list _(Example: I am guilty of three of the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, and sloth.)_
*  a quotation _(Example: Consider the words of Minnie Riperton: "Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful.")_

Don't use capitalization after a colon in text, unless it's in a heading or subheading. *(Example: "Patient: The True Story of a Rare Illness")*

**Commas**

Use a serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma) before "and" or "or" in a series. *(Example: I went to the store for beer, ice cream, and fireworks.)*

Use a comma to set off the year in a complete date, but don't use a comma within the month and year. *(Examples: Be sure to offload your steps by October 31, 2016. The contest will end in October 2016.)*

For professional degrees, use a comma after the degree if the name doesn't end the sentence. *(Example: Meghan Neuringer, MD, will meet with you now.)*

Use a comma between the elements of an address or after the name of a state. *(Example: The party bus left Boston, Massachusetts on Friday and arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada the following Wednesday.)*

**Company name**

Our official company name is MYH, Inc. You can write “MeYou Health,” or you can write “MYH, Inc.,” but do not write “MeYou Health, Inc.”

Don’t refer to MeYou Health as “MeYou”

Don’t refer to MeYou Health as MYH in first reference. You can refer to MeYou Health as MYH in second and subsequent references. *(Example: MeYou Health helps you do more. Let MYH demo its platform for you today.)*

Whenever possible, do not use “MeYou Health’s” when writing. *(Examples: MeYou Health technology improves your population’s well-being. The MeYou Health well-being platform drives engagement.)*

**Ellipses**

A space appears before the first period and after the third period. *(Example: Try it out ... you might like it.)*

**Exclamation points**

Use only one at the end of a sentence, no matter how excited you are (**Note:** If you use one in a headline, avoid using one in the first few lines of the body copy that accompanies it.)

**Job titles**


**Question marks**

Use only one at the end of a sentence, no matter how urgent your question.

**Quotation marks**

They always go outside of commas, periods, exclamation points, question marks, and ellipses.

_Examples:_

* _"I think I've found the answer!"_
* _"Oh, really?"_
* _"Well ..." he said, "maybe not."_
* _"That's OK." She smiled. "There's always next time."_
