##Consistency##

###A###

• AM and PM, not am and pm or a.m. and p.m. (Use small caps if possible.)

###C###

• check in is a verb; check-in is a noun *(Examples: Please check in at the desk. Mobile check-in is available starting today.)*

###D###

• database, one word

###E###

• ellipses: a space appears before the first period and after the third period. *(Example: Try it out ... you might like it.)*

• exclamation points: use only one at the end of a sentence, no matter how excited you are (Note: If you use one in a headline, avoid using one in the first few lines of the body copy that accompanies it.)  

###F###

• fractions: Always spell out. One-third, not ⅓. (Exception: in recipes)

• follow up is a verb; follow-up is a noun *(Examples: We are writing to follow up. I want to schedule a follow-up.)*

• full time/part time: have a hyphen when used as adjectives but not when used as adverbs *(Examples: He is a full-time employee. I work part time.)*

###H###

• health care provider, not health-care provider

• HRA or health risk assessment

###I###

###N###

• non - prefix doesn't use a hyphen unless it's followed by a capitalized word or a word that starts with "n" *(Examples: nonprofit, nonfat BUT non-Catholic, non-negotiable)*

###O###

• OK, not O.K. or okay

###P###

• percent: Use %, do not spell out. Should be used after each numeral. 15% to 20%, not 15 to 20% or 15-20%

• phone numbers: (xxx) xxx-xxxx. You don’t need a “1” before the first parenthesis.

• pre- and post- : no hyphen unless followed by capitals *(Examples: prenatal, postgraduate, pre-MIT)*

###Q###

• question marks: use only one at the end of a sentence, no matter how urgent your question

• quotation marks: always go outside of commas, periods, exclamation points, question marks, and ellipses *(Examples: "I think I've found the answer!" // "Oh, really?" // "Well ..." he said, "maybe not." // "OK." She turned back around. "There's always next time.")*

###R###

###W###

• web, lowercase

###Z###

##Style##

###A###

• Acronyms and Abbreviations - neither require periods after each letter *(Examples: SCUBA, MGH)* Avoid using them in the title or subtitle. 

• Addresses - 

(1) spell out Road, Street, Boulevard, Lane, etc. 
(2) never abbreviate the name of any city, except for St. *(Examples: St. Louis, St. Paul)* 
(3) unless it's within a mailing address, never abbreviate the name of a state *(Example: Our home office is located in Massachusetts.)*

• Apostrophes - don't use them to make something plural *(Examples: 1980s, ABCs)*

###B###

• Bullets - Use them to make a long, multiclause sentence easier to read. Precede the bullets with a word that is common to all the bullets. Follow that word with a colon. If the bulleted list involves complete sentences, capitalize and punctuate each item. 

_Example:_

_There are three reasons why we can't give you a raise:_

* _We often find you asleep at your desk._
* _Your colleagues say you are insufferable._
* _You have been wearing a your Halloween costume for a month now._

But if the list involves sentence fragments, don't capitalize after the bullet or punctuate after each item.

*Example:
We can't give you a raise because you are:
• often asleep at your desk
• insufferable
• stinky in your Halloween costume
